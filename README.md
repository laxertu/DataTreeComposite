# DataTreeComposite

This package is intended for those who need easly defining data trees that can be easly processed for transformation / presentation
purposed. It's especially useful for implementing webservice request / responses. Some classes for most common formats (Json, XML, array), and other classes (SoapVar, StdClass) are
present too.

I think that reading tests' sources is a good way to understand it's usage. 

In thw same directory a sandbox.php is provided in order to allow make some experiment.

coming soon: XML namespaces support, automatic generation from schemas,
