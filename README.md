# DataTreeComposite

This package is intended for those who need defining data trees that can be easly processed for transformation / presentation
purposes.

It's especially useful for implementation of webservices requests / responses. Some classes for most common formats (Json, XML, array), and other types (SoapVar, StdClass) are
present too.

I think that reading tests' sources is a good way to understand usage. There is also an usage example here: https://github.com/laxertu/DataTreeComposite/wiki

In the same directory a sandbox.php is provided in order to allow starting with some experiment ;-)

Coming soon:

XML namespaces support, automatic generation from schemas.
